With MULTISENSE (you should have installed ROS Groovy first)

Connect the sensor via ethernet, connect the supply and then (T1, T2, T3 are different terminals):
T1) cd
source groovy.bash
make lcm-local
make multisense-driver (!!! be sure that Multisense was already connected!!!)

T2) cd
source groovy.bash
roslaunch multisense_bringup multisense.launch

T3) cd
source groovy.bash
cd catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun pedestrian_crossing pedestrian_crossing

3 windows appear : 
Pointcloud viewer
Original image
Post-processed image

With ROSBAGS

T1) cd 
source groovy.bash
roscore

T2) cd
source groovy.bash
cd catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun pedestrian_crossing pedestrian_crossing

Only the pointcloud viewer will show up before you start a bagfile

T3) cd
source groovy.bash
cd data/bagfiles/pedestrian_crossing/[example..]csail/Very_Good/
rosbag play filename

Now also the other 2 windows will show up and you can see the code working.
