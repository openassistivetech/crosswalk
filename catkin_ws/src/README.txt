FOLDERS EXPLAINATION:
1)canny, point_cloud_multisense
Auxiliary folder used during the development of the code, do not consider them

2)multisense-3.1
Multisense driver, including organized point clouds topics (/multisense/image_points2_color_organized and /multisense/image_points2_organized). An organized point cloud is very useful because you can easily reproject it to a 2D image.

3)pedestrain_crossing
This is the folder where the relevant files are placed.

For prerequisites see "pedestrian_crossing-requirements.txt"
For launching the program see "pedestrian_crossing_launch.txt"
For TODO thing see "Future_work.txt"
