FOLDERS EXPLAINATION:
	canny, point_cloud_multisense
Auxiliary folder used during the development of the code. 
	multisense-3.1
Multisense driver, including organized point clouds topics (/multisense/image_points2_color_organized and /multisense/image_points2_organized). An organized point cloud is very useful because you can easily reproject it to a 2D image.
Command to start the Multisense (check pedestrian_crossing_launch.txt):
 in home directory : make lcm-local, make multisense-driver
 roslaunch multisense_bringup multisense.launch
	pedestrian_crossing
Main project folder. Uses /multisense/image_points2_color_organized from the sensor or bagfiles and detects pedestrian crossings. See the README inside that folder for further information.
To start the project : in catkin_ws directory : source devel/setup.bash, rosrun pedestrian_crossing pedestrian_crossing
